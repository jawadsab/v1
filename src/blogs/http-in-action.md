Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you navigate to a specific URL on your laptop or smartphone ? How do you GET back the data you need from the internet ? How are you able to browse through different websites on the internet ? This is all possible with the help of **HTTP** protocol which powers the entire internet.



Whether you are an aspiring web developer or you are someone who are really curious to know how the web works, this blog is for you to understand HTTP protocol.



A typical web application has a **Client-Server architecture.** In simple words the browser you use to navigate to a website is called as client and the machine from where the website content or data comes back as response is called as the server. Broadly speaking, here’s what happens. You open up your browser. You type a specific URL and then you hit Enter. As soon as you hit Enter a *request* is sent from your computer to a remote machine called *server.* A server is a machine where all related data of a website is stored. If the server is able to match the request to a website, it serves the HTML file back to your browser as response. URL is mapped to an IP address of the server with the help of DNS(Domain Name Server ) lookup. For transferring a website to a browser, HTTP is used as the communication protocol for requests and responses between client and web server. This is why there is a **“http”** in front of every URL.
